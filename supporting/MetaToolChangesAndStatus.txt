PCR PinCR
50 uL vol betw existing well plate and plastic cover/layer, then fit metal heat post inside.

The following is relative to v 0011-9


Sample section (Bill, 29-Jan-21)
 x Capture molecule as is
 x Blocking (orange), default=none, list as is (move up)
 x Standard:  PN (list), lot # (list)
 x Sample Matrix: dropdown, Vendor (list: Sigma, CSC, Cytiva, MP Bio, Thermo), Lot # (list from bill)
 x Sample Volume (list) ,
   x tooltip "volume of the analyte/sample matrix added to the buffer/OSS diluent", buffer/OSS Vol, x x calculated dil factor (=(sample volume+OSS Vol)/sample volume), 
   x calculated "% matrix" = (1/dilution factor)*100
 x buffer and salt default to PBSx and 150 mM, move down 1 row
 x Vol loaded, tip "Volume put into consumable well", default 55, list 55, 100, 200

From meeting 28-Jan-21
General
  Make a "blank all" button
 x Make "blank" button for each section
  Change field color for any field I blanked on load

"User/Customer" section - the required stuff:
 x Analyte ID stays as is (required, not blanked ever)
 x Change name "ID" to "Target"
 x Blank assay concentration on load of program, don't blank between submits
 x In required section, Assay conc TT: "final concentration of target analyte in well"

Consumable Info
 x Change "Sample Maker (who)" to "Sample Mfg (site)", dynamo update to be site rather than person

Sample info:
 x Add lot # to cap molecule section next to "ID"
   x add to dynamo as str
   x write to metaDict.json and savedValues.json
	propagate to uploader
	back end
 x Blank lot # on load, keep run to run

  Add "Analyte PN" (changed to "Standard" post meeting), "Analyte Lot #"
  next to Analyte Vol (changed to , add "Diluent Vol (uL)", text field, add calculated dil factor: (dil+anal)/anal_vol

Under Analyte/Sample, OSS = "Oxygen Scavenger System added to matrix"

Detection molecule:
 x make ID wider
 x A list will be made in Michigan for dynamo update
  Change "Imaging Solution Vol (µL) to "Imaging Sol Loaded (µL)"
  Add "Fluorophore", dropdown, "Cy5","Alexa", "Other"
  Blank lot # on close/reopen

Folder Choosing:
  "Next" button to select and autopopulate next from folder list without opening Tweak
